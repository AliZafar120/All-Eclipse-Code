Motivation

	The adapter pattern is adapting between classes and objects. Like any adapter 
	in the real world it is used to be an interface, a bridge between two objects.
	
Intent

	1.Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
	
	2.Adapter lets classes work together, that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
